What does it do?
================

Structured data is essential for search engine optimisation nowadays. This
extension allows the easy integration of structured data based on the
`schema.org vocabulary <https://schema.org/>`_ on a TYPO3 website. A good
introduction to the topic is provided by Google:
`Understand how structured data works <https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data>`_.

The defined structured data is embedded on a web page in
`JSON-LD <https://json-ld.org/>`_ markup and can be checked with the
`Schema Markup Validator <https://validator.schema.org/>`_ and
Google's `Rich Results Test <https://search.google.com/test/rich-results>`_.
The JSON-LD generated by this extension can also be checked in the
:ref:`Admin Panel <admin-panel>`.


You can find the adjustments between the extension versions in the
`change log <https://github.com/brotkrueml/schema/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`_.

.. tip::
   There is a Slack channel
   `#ext-schema <https://typo3.slack.com/archives/CV36M73D5>`_ on
   `typo3.slack.com <https://typo3.slack.com/>`_ for questions, suggestions,
   feedback, etc.


.. _vocabulary:

The schema.org vocabulary
=========================

Schema.org is a set of extensible schemas that enables webmasters to embed
structured data on their web pages for use by search engines and other
applications. The vocabulary is divided into different sections:

- The **core** vocabulary provides all default types and properties, like
  ``Person`` or ``Organization``.
- The **pending** section is a staging area for work-in-progress terms which
  have yet to be accepted into the core vocabulary.
  `Pending terms <https://schema.org/docs/pending.home.html>`_ are subject
  to change and should be used with caution. On the schema.org website they
  are displayed in a blue colour.
- The **auto** section provides additional terms related to
  `auto <https://schema.org/docs/auto.home.html>`_.
- The **bib** section provides additional terms related to
  `bibliography <https://schema.org/docs/bib.home.html>`_.
- The **health-lifesci** section provides additional terms related to
  `health and lifesciences <https://schema.org/docs/health-lifesci.home.html>`_.

.. note::
   This TYPO3 schema extension provides the terms for the core vocabulary. To
   use terms from other sections you can extend the vocabulary on your own as
   described in the :ref:`according chapter <extending-vocabulary>` or use one
   of the additional TYPO3 extensions provided by the author of this extension:

   - `schema_auto <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/schema_auto>`_
   - `schema_bib <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/schema_bib>`_
   - `schema_health <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/schema_health>`_
   - `schema_pending <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/schema_pending>`_

The schema.org vocabulary is evolving, approx. every 3-4 months a new version
is `released <https://schema.org/docs/releases.html>`_. The TYPO3 extensions are
updated when changes are made to the according vocabulary. The classes for the
type models and view helpers are generated by the `schema-generator
<https://github.com/brotkrueml/schema-generator>`_ library.

You can browse through a :ref:`list of types <available-types>` available
for a TYPO3 installation.

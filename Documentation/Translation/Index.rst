Override translations
=====================

You can override translations in the usual way. Have a look into the
according TYPO3 documentation:
:ref:`Custom translations <t3coreapi:xliff-translating-custom>`.

However, if you feel that a translation provided by the translation server could
be improved, please suggest an alternative on `Crowdin`_.

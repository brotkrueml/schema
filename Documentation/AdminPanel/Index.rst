   Types information in the Admin Panel

The icons are linked: The type to the according schema.org documentation and - if
available - to the Google and Yandex references for the specific type, other
URLs to their destination.

Additionally, you can call the `Schema Markup Validator`_ and
`Google's Rich Result Test`_ to validate the structured data on the specific
page.

.. _Google's Rich Result Test: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
.. _Schema Markup Validator: https://validator.schema.org/

.. hint::
   Since the JSON-LD markup is fetched from the page cache, please make sure
   that this cache is enabled (for example, no use of the
   :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Cache\Backend\NullBackend`). Otherwise you will not
   see any markup.


Configuration
=============

To allow non-admin users to access the schema information in the Admin Panel,
you have to configure it in the corresponding user TSconfig:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   admPanel {
      enable {
         ext-schema = 1
      }
   }

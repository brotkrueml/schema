With an activated Admin Panel, you can display the structured data on a page
generated by this extension for reviewing:

.. figure:: /Images/AdminPanel/TypesInformation.png
   :alt: Types information in the Admin Panel

   Types information in the Admin Panel

The icons are linked: The type to the according schema.org documentation and - if
available - to the Google and Yandex references for the specific type, other
URLs to their destination.

Additionally, you can call the `Schema Markup Validator
<https://validator.schema.org/>`_ and `Google's Rich Result Test
<https://search.google.com/test/rich-results>`_ to validate the structured data
on the specific page.

.. hint::
   Since the JSON-LD markup is fetched from the page cache, please make sure
   that this cache is enabled (e.g. no use of the :php:`NullBackend`). Otherwise
   you will not see any markup.


Configuration
=============

To allow non-admin users to access the schema information in the Admin Panel,
you have to configure it in the corresponding UserTS:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   admPanel {
      enable {
         ext-schema = 1
      }
   }

.. note::

   The extension is available for TYPO3 9 LTS and TYPO3 v10.

The recommended way to install this extension is by using Composer. In your Composer-based TYPO3 project root, just type

.. code-block:: bash

   composer req brotkrueml/schema

and the latest stable release will be installed.

But you can also install the extension from the `TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER) <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/schema/>`__.

The extension configuration offers some basic configuration which is explained in the :ref:`Configuration <Configuration>` chapter.
